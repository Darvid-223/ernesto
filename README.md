## Deployment
### Github Pages

The website for Restaurant Ernesto is hosted on GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy a repository on GitHub Pages are as follows:

1. Ensure that your project has an `index.html` file at the root level. GitHub Pages looks for this file to serve as the entry point for the website.

2. Log in to GitHub and navigate to your repository. In this case, the repository is located at [Ernesto](https://github.com/Darvid-223/ernesto/).

3. Once in the repository, click on the 'Settings' tab, which is towards the top of the page.

4. Scroll down to the 'GitHub Pages' section.

5. Under 'Source', click on the dropdown menu and select the branch you want to deploy. If you're deploying from the master/main branch and your project doesn't use a build process, choose 'master/main'. If your project requires a build step, you might need to select a 'gh-pages' branch or a `/docs` folder.

6. After selecting the branch, the page will automatically refresh, and GitHub will begin the deployment process.

7. Once deployed, GitHub will provide you with a link to the live site. For the Restaurant Ernesto project, the live site can be found at [https://darvid-223.github.io/ernesto/](https://darvid-223.github.io/ernesto/).

Remember that it might take a few minutes for the changes to go live. If you make further updates to your project, those changes will be automatically deployed to your GitHub Pages site upon push to the selected branch.

For additional settings like custom domains, refer to the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages).
